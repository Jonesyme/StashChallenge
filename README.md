#### iOS Coding Challenge

* **Date:** November 27, 2018
* **Compiler:** XCode 10.0
* **Language:** Swift 4.2

#### Brief Notes
I did not use any 3rd-party libraries - not that they wouldn't have been useful - I simply felt like making my life more difficult. Hope you don't mind that I modified the achievements.json file to fetch the background images from my personal server.  Just didn't seem fair loading them locally.  

If I had more time I would make the networking calls more generic/reusable and max out the code coverage but alas...

All said, one of the more enjoyable challenges I've come across - appreciate the opportunity :)
